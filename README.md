## 🎨 My Pookalam

### Description
My Pookalam design is inspired by the idea of growth and harmony, where each layer blooms outward like petals of a flower. I began with a calm, bright base circle symbolizing unity, then added radiating triangular spikes to capture energy and celebration. The petals, built with layered gradients, represent beauty and diversity blending together, while the star-shaped core symbolizes light and positivity at the heart of the design. The approach was to balance traditional floral motifs with dynamic animation, so the Pookalam feels alive and evolving, much like the festive spirit of Onam itself.
